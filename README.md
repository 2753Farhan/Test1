# SQL Injection Vulnerability Detection Project using C++

This project aims to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in a given user input for a SQL database using C++ programming language. SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into SQL statements, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even deletion of entire databases.

## Installation

To run the project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries and tools, such as libcurl.
2.Most of the codes are executed on dvwa.Download dvwa and configure it on your pc.
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor, such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.
4. Build and compile the project using the provided makefile.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the compiled executable file.
2. Provide the necessary inputs.
3. The tool will analyze the input and detect any suspicious characters or code that could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The project includes a sample SQL database and a set of test cases to demonstrate the tool's functionality. The test cases cover various scenarios that can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, such as using single quotes, double quotes, semicolons, and other special characters.

Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used to detect vulnerabilities in a production environment. It is recommended to use a professional security tool to perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
